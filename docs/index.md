# NArr
pronounced: <b>(ˈnär, as in gnarly)</b> stands for: <b>Native Array</b><br />

NArr gives you native Array performance on all platforms: JVM, JS, and Native.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?  Because: <a href="https://youtu.be/n5u7DgFwLGE?t=720">"Arrays are really good!  As good as you think Arrays are, they are better, uhm, they are just super, super, good!"</a> - Daniel Spiewak
